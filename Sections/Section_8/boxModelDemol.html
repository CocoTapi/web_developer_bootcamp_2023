        <h2>I Am Dodger</h2>
        <p>I love playing with toys. My favorite toy is blue scrape fabric. 
            I love people but very shy first so you might not be able to find me
            when you visit my house. I am neat so please clean my restroom
            very often! I am very polite so I won't break any stuff that my owners 
            leave on the table, shelf, or wherever it is. Just be careful for my treat!
            I have a good sense of smell haha.
