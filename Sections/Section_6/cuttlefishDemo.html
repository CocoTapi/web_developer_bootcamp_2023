            Cuttlefish or cuttles
            <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
            are
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean">marine</a>
            molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong
            to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses.
            Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.

            <p>
                The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the end of the Cretaceous
                period,
                <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
                <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
                represented by Ceratisepia from the Late Maastrichtian
                Maastricht Formation of the Netherlands.
                <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
                Although the Jurassic
                Trachyteuthis was historically considered possibly related to cuttlefish,
                <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
                later studies considered to be more closely related to octopus and vampire squid.

                <h3>Visual system</h3>
                <p>
                    Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the
                    final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates
                    such as humans.[15] Superficial similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes
                    are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly 
                    curving W-shape.[16][17] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[18] they can perceive 
                    the polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two 
                    spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look more 
                    forward, and one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position 
                    of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals. 
                    Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned 
                    behind the retina. They are capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern 
                    depth/distance because their brain calculates the input from both eyes.[19][20] 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The cuttlefish's eyes are thought to be fully developed before birth, and they start 
                    observing their surroundings while still in the egg. In consequence, they may 
                    prefer to hunt the prey they saw before hatching.[21]

                <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
                <p>
                    The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the 
                    copper-containing protein haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing 
                    protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood. The blood is pumped by three separate 
                    hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart 
                    for each), and the third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must 
                    flow more rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries substantially 
                    less oxygen than haemoglobin. Unlike most other mollusks, cephalopods like cuttlefish 
                    have a closed circulatory system.[22]

                    Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous 
                    and is made of aragonite. The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish 
                    regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the 
                    ventral siphuncle.[23] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and 
                    pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of 
                    the features that distinguish them from their squid relatives.[24]
